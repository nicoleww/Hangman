<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The aim of this project was to create a functioning game of hangman with an anxious twist--that report that's due at 5pm, waiting to be sent.</p>
<p>The goal is to guess the correct email sign-off within six turns.</p>
<p>The player can choose any letters and put them in the input form to be compared with the secret word.</p>
